The variables in this data set includes:- 

1. Activity :- This tells about the activity being performed by the subject at the time. Numeric values are:-
	* 1 - Walking 
	* 2- Walking Upstairs 
	* 3- walking Downstairs 
	* 4- Sitting 
	* 5- Standing 
	* 6- Laying 

2. Subject- Consists of 30 values, each for a volunteer.  

3. TimeBodyAccelerometerMean(X,Y,Z)- This tells about the mean about the body's acceleration in X, Y or Z direction respectively at different times based on "Activity" for differenct subjects. 

4. TimeBodyAccelerometerSD(X,Y,Z)- This tells about the standard deviation of the body's acceleration in X, Y or Z direction respectively at different times based on "Activity" for differenct subjects. 

5. TimeBodyAccelerometerJerkMean(X,Y,Z)- The body's linear acceleration mean were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals at different times based on "Activity" for differenct subjects. 

6. TimeBodyAccelerometerJerkSD(X,Y,Z)- The body's linear acceleration standard deviation were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals at different times based on "Activity" for differenct subjects.  

Similarly the data is based on frequency obtained by applying Fourier Transform on the data to produce the similar variables in the data starting with "f".
